Below is an example **high-level class/module structure** you could use to reorganize this large script in a more modular and maintainable way. The idea is to separate:

1. **Hardware Device Classes** (sensors, camera, LEDs, etc.)  
2. **User Interface (UI) Components** (OLED display, menu navigation, button input, etc.)  
3. **Helpers/Utilities** (logging, file I/O, time/date calculations, error handling, etc.)  
4. **Main Controller** (the orchestrator that ties it all together)

This is not the only way to structure your application, but it should give you a starting point to keep each concern clearly separated. You would create a directory layout similar to this:

```
lepmon
├── __init__.py
├── main.py               # The main entry-point script (previous "Hauptskript")
├── devices
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── bh1750.py
│   ├── pct2075.py
│   ├── ina226.py
│   ├── bme280_sensor.py
│   ├── camera.py
│   ├── led.py
│   ├── rtc.py
│   └── ...
├── ui
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── oled_display.py
│   ├── menu_manager.py
│   └── button_input.py
├── utils
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── file_ops.py
│   ├── time_ops.py
│   ├── error_handling.py
│   ├── logger.py
│   └── ...
└── config
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── constants.py      # Shared constants, pin assignments, paths, etc.
    └── ...
```

Below is a breakdown of how each part might look (in greatly simplified/pseudocode form). You would copy/paste and adapt pieces of your original code into these classes/modules.

---

## 1. **Devices (Sensors, Camera, LEDs, etc.)**

### 1.1 BH1750 (Light Sensor)

```python
# lepmon/devices/bh1750.py

```

### 1.2 PCT2075 (Temperature Sensor)

```python
# lepmon/devices/pct2075.py

```

### 1.3 INA226 (Current/Voltage Measurement)

```python
# lepmon/devices/ina226.py
```

### 1.4 BME280 (Pressure, Humidity, Temp)

```python
# lepmon/devices/bme280_sensor.py
```

### 1.5 Camera (Allied Vision or Arducam)

```python
# lepmon/devices/camera.py
```

### 1.6 LED Control

```python
# lepmon/devices/led.py
```

---

## 2. **UI Components (OLED, Menus, Buttons)**

### 2.1 OLED Display

```python
# lepmon/ui/oled_display.py
```

### 2.2 Button Input

```python
# lepmon/ui/button_input.py
```

### 2.3 Menu Manager

```python
# lepmon/ui/menu_manager.py
```

---

## 3. **Utilities (Logging, File, Time/Date, Error Handling)**

### 3.1 Logger

```python
```

### 3.2 File Ops

```python
# lepmon/utils/file_ops.py
```

### 3.3 Time Ops

```python
# lepmon/utils/time_ops.py
```

### 3.4 Error Handling

```python
# lepmon/utils/error_handling.py
```

---

## 4. **Main Controller** (`main.py`)

Finally, in a main script (e.g. `lepmon/main.py`), you tie everything together:

```python
# lepmon/main.py


```

# Key Takeaways

1. **Separate Out Devices**  
   Each physical sensor or device (camera, LED driver, BH1750, BME280, INA226, etc.) becomes its own class (or at least its own file) to keep the logic isolated and easily testable.

2. **Separate UI (OLED, Buttons)**  
   Put all display- and user-input-related code under `ui/`. This avoids mixing hardware calls with user menu logic.

3. **Use Utility Modules**  
   Shared functionality like logging, reading/writing files (CSV, JSON), computing checksums, or time calculations (twilight, local time, etc.) should live in `utils/`, so your main script does not become bloated.

4. **Have a Main Orchestrator**  
   The `main.py` (or any single “driver script”) pulls all these modular pieces together, reading from config files as needed, and runs the core loop (or schedules tasks).

5. **Keep Constants & Configs**  
   Put your pin assignments, global paths, environment variables, user settings, etc. in one place (a `config/` folder or a `constants.py` file). This makes it easier to adapt or debug hardware changes later.

This approach will make your code **much more maintainable**, easier to test, and more flexible for future hardware or feature upgrades. You can now test each sensor class or UI component in isolation instead of wading through a monolithic script.
